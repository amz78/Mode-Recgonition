# Mode-Recognition

Additional viusalizations to our Paper "Mode Recognition by Shape Morphing for Maxwell's Eigenvalue Problem"

-Field visualizations are provided for the electric and magnetic field of the TM018 mode in the TESLA cavity, see Fig. 10 in the paper.
They can be visualized with e.g. ParaView by opening the e_mode_9_.pvd file (h_mode_9_.pvd resp.) and the field visualizations can be followed along the tracking. 

-CAD data will be provided soon
